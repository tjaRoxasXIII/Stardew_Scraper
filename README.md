This repository serves as practice for coding for my own personal benefit and the end-goal would be to scrape the official Stardew Wiki site and store the data locally so that it may be viewed and used offline as a stand-alone app with a more usable mobile interface.  Currently written in python (and html for browser viewing while testing) and will be converted to Kotlin once I get to a more usable point.
